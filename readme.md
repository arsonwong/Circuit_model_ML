# 📦 Circuit Model ML – Overview
Circuit Model ML is a Python package that trains a graph NN to solve electrical networks.
the repo contains tools that generate randomized grid-based circuits with resistors, current sources, and diodes, 
and solvers using traditional numerical methods (Newton-Raphson iterations)

# 🛠️ Getting Started
1. Install dependencies - 
Navigate to the package directory and run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

1. Run example code
You can test the package functionality by executing the a01_example_circuit_network.py
